# Portfolio Management Strategy with Genetic Algorithm

## Overview

This project presents a portfolio management strategy utilizing a genetic algorithm, implemented using Python for data analysis and visualization and MATLAB for the algorithmic part. The strategy aims to optimize portfolio allocations across various types of stocks, including Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), to maximize returns while managing risk.

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Python is used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of historical stock prices, market trends, and asset correlations.

- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: MATLAB is employed to implement a genetic algorithm for portfolio optimization. The genetic algorithm generates and evolves candidate portfolios based on a set of parameters, including asset returns, volatilities, correlations, and constraints.

- **Asset Selection and Allocation**: The portfolio management strategy considers a diverse range of stocks, including equities and REITs, to achieve portfolio diversification and risk mitigation.

- **Risk Management**: The genetic algorithm incorporates risk management techniques to control portfolio volatility, drawdowns, and downside risk.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Portfolio performance is evaluated using various metrics, including Sharpe ratio, annualized returns, standard deviation, and maximum drawdown.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect historical stock price data for the selected assets and preprocess the data using Python scripts.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct exploratory data analysis using Python to gain insights into asset performance, correlations, and market trends.

3. **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: Develop and implement the genetic algorithm for portfolio optimization using MATLAB.

4. **Portfolio Construction**: Construct the optimized portfolio based on the output of the genetic algorithm.

5. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the portfolio using Python scripts.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib

- MATLAB
  - Optimization Toolbox

## Conclusion

This portfolio management strategy leverages the power of data analysis, visualization, and algorithmic optimization to construct and manage diversified portfolios effectively. By combining Python for data analytics and MATLAB for algorithmic modeling, the strategy provides a comprehensive approach to portfolio optimization and risk management.
